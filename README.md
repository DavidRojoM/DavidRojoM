# Hey, I'm David Rojo.

A software developer based in Málaga, specialized in web technologies like NestJs and Angular, among others. You can find a comprehensive list of my skills in the "Skills" section of my LinkedIn profile.

During my spare time, I thrive on building side-projects, tackling challenging problems, reading, attending conferences, and contributing to open source projects.

Additionally, I've proudly served as volunteer staff and organizer for 3 editions at BiznagaFest, a prominent tech event in Málaga that attracts over 500 attendees.

If you have any interesting projects or ideas that require collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to take on exciting new opportunities.
